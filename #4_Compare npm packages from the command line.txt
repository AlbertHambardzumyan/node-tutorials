#Compare npm packages from the command line

There are over 350,000 packages on npm. There are more than a billion downloads per week. With so many new packages, it becomes difficult to select the right package for you projects.

Express vs Connect vs Koa

Tools like npmcompare.com (https://npmcompare.com/) and npms.io make choosing easier.

Enter npm-compare. Compare npm packages right from your terminal. Powered by the npms.io api.

Start using it right away by
npm install --global npm-compare

Although this shouldn’t be the only criteria for selecting a package. I hope this helps you make an informed decision.

Have a great day :)
